# Binary Tree Package

### What This Module Does:
This binary tree module allows the user to sort an inputed string of numbers into a binary tree and have the numbers sorted in ascending order.

### How This Module Works:
Upon running the user_binary_tree.py file, you will see the prompt "Enter number of elements." Here is where you input how many numbers you would like to add to your list. From there, you will receive a prompt saying "Enter the numbers." Enter your elements here with spaces between each number. From here, you will see your list of numbers printed as you inputed them into the tree followed by your list sorted in ascending order.
